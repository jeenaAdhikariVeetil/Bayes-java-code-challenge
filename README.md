# Bayes Java Dota Challlenge

## Assumptions
-------------

1. Ignored all the events that are not of the types mentioned in the question.

2. Also, All actors and targets are expected to start with "npc_dota_hero_". All other formats are ignored.

3. Hero name should not be empty.

## Improvements
---------
1. Parsing of events can be done with pattern matcher which would have reduced the complexity.

2. Improvements are required on the perfomance front.

3. There is a scope to implement any asynchronus event processing mechanism to imporve the latency and throughput of the application.

4. Tables can be normalized to improve the data integrity and perfomance.

5. Scope for better test coverage.

6. Add depedency of actuators for health check monitoring.

7. Extensive documentation

8. Scope for Docker file or similar to run the application in a container.
   
Thanks a lot for the challenge! It was a wonderful experience.
